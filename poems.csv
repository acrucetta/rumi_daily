3,"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,\nthere is a field. I'll meet you there.\nWhen the soul lies down in that grass,\nthe world is too full to talk about.\nIdeas, language, even the phrase each other\ndoesn't make any sense.\n\n- Rumi"
4,"This being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes\nas an unexpected visitor.\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house\empty of its furniture,\nstill, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out\nfor some new delight.\n\n- Rumi"
5,"The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.\nDon't go back to sleep!\nYou must ask for what you really want.\nDon't go back to sleep!\nPeople are going back and forth\nacross the doorsill where the two worlds touch,\nThe door is round and open.\nDon't go back to sleep!\n\n- Rumi"
6,"You were born with potential.\nYou were born with goodness and trust.\nYou were born with ideals and dreams.\nYou were born with greatness.\nYou were born with wings.\nYou are not meant for crawling, so don’t.\nYou have wings.\nLearn to use them and fly.\n\n- Rumi"
7,"Don’t be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others.\nUnfold your own myth, without complicated explanation,\nso everyone will understand the passage,\nWe have opened you.\n\n- Rumi"

15,"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,\nThe ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,\nThe port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\nWhile follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;\nBut O heart! heart! heart!\nO the bleeding drops of red,\nWhere on the deck my Captain lies,\nFallen cold and dead.\n\n- Walt Whitman, 'O Captain! My Captain!'"
16,"When I heard the learn’d astronomer,\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\nTill rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\nLook’d up in perfect silence at the stars.\n\n- Walt Whitman, 'When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer'"
17,"Do I contradict myself?\nVery well then I contradict myself,\n(I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n\n- Walt Whitman, 'Song of Myself'"
